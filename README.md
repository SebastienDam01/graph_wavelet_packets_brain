# Graph Wavelet Packets for the Classification of Brain Data in Anxiety and Depression

This repository contains code supporting the paper titled ["Graph Wavelet Packets for the Classification of Brain Data in Anxiety and Depression" (Dam et al. 2024)](https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO63174.2024.10715179)

---

## Repository Contents

The repository includes functions (located in the `src` directory) to compute the graph wavelet packets, given weighted adjacency matrices representing brain connectivity matrices. 

### Original code

The original code is provided in the Julia package of Natural Graph Wavelet Packet Dictionaries [here](https://github.com/UCD4IDS/MultiscaleGraphSignalTransforms.jl). 

### Data

Due to the Data Use Terms from the NIMH Data Archive (NDA), the NDA Data Use Certification (DUC) was signed, under which the data used in the paper is shared. 
More information on obtaining NDA access is available in the [Data Access and Download Instructions](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/LS2.0/LS_Release_2.0_Access_Instructions_June2022.pdf). 

### Preprocessing 

The preprocessing steps of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/SebastienDam01/BANDA_preprocessing).
